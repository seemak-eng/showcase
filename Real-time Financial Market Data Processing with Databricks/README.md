**Title: Real-time Financial Market Data Processing with Databricks**

**Platform:** Microsoft Azure

**Tool:** Databricks

**Framework:** Apache Spark  and Microsoft Azure Data Factory ( Would definitely like to explore Apache Flink, Apache Kafka and Apache Hadoop with possible usecase)

**Dataset:** ALPHA VANTAGE

**Description:** This suite of APIs provide global equity data in 4 different temporal resolutions: (1) daily, (2) weekly, (3) monthly, and (4) intraday, with 20+ years of historical depth. A lightweight ticker quote endpoint and several utility functions such as ticker search and market open/closure status are also included for your convenience.
